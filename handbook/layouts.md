# Layouts

In Phlex, _everything is a component_. A “view” is just a component that renders an entire HTML document — typically starting with `<!doctype html>` and ending with `</html>`. Views are also entrypoints — they’re usually rendered directly from a controller.

In this world of components, where do _layouts_ fit in? Rails’ built-in view library, `ActionView`, has a special concept of layouts where they are separate from the rest of your views (and partials) and treated differently. ActionView renders the view first and then wraps it in a layout right at the end.

There are a few problems with this approach:

1. it adds complexity to the rendering process — there’s a whole different concept to understand with special rules;
2. it necessitates the `content_for` helper and strange `yield` behaviours in order to get content from the view up into the layout; and
3. it makes it impossible to stream the response to the client until both the view and the layout are ready.

In Phlex, layouts are just components.

## Layouts through composition

The simplest way to implement layouts in Phlex is through _composition_. You render a view from a controller and the first thing it does is render the layout component passing content via a block.

::: code-group

```ruby{2,5} [controller]
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  layout false

  def index
    render Views::Articles::Index.new(
      articles: Article.all.limit(10)
    )
  end
end
```

```ruby{7} [view]
class Views::Articles::Index < Views::Base
  def initialize(articles:)
    @articles = articles
  end

  def view_template
    Layout(title: "Articles") do
      h1 { "Articles" }

      ul do
        @articles.each do |article|
          li { article.title }
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby{14} [layout]
class Components::Layout < Components::Base
  def initialize(title:)
    @title = title
  end

  def view_template
    doctype

    html do
      head do
        title { @title }
      end

      body { yield }
    end
  end
end
```

## Layouts through inheritance

Another way to implement layouts in Phlex is through inheritance. You create a base class for your views to inherit from, and that base view actually renders the layout around the template.

In this example, we use the `around_template` hook. Alternatively, we could have just defined a `view_template` method in the base class and called `super`.

::: code-group

```ruby [controller]
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  layout false

  def index
    render Views::Articles::Index.new(
      articles: Article.all.limit(10)
    )
  end
end
```

```ruby{6} [view]
class Views::Articles::Index < Views::Base
  def initialize(articles:)
    @articles = articles
  end

  def page_title = "Articles"

  def view_template
    h1 { "Articles" }

    ul do
      @articles.each do |article|
        li { article.title }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby{2,10} [base view (layout)]
class Views::Base < Phlex::HTML
  def around_template
    doctype

    html do
      head do
        title { page_title }
      end

      body { super }
    end
  end
end
```

:::

Notice in the above example how we use a method to set the title of the page. The super class could call the method, requiring the subclass to implement it.

## Combining inheritance and composition

The final approach is to combine both inheritance and composition. This final example has quite a lot going on, but it’s extremely flexible.

- the controller renders the view as normal
- the view defines `#page_title` and `#layout` methods
- the base view uses the `#around_template` hook to render the layout that was specified by the view
- it passes a `page_info` object to the layout component containing the page title
- finally, the layout takes the `page_info` object and renders as normal

::: code-group

```ruby [controller]
class ArticlesController < ApplicationController
  layout false

  def index
    render Views::Articles::Index.new(
      articles: Article.all.limit(10)
    )
  end
end
```

```ruby{6-7} [view]
class Views::Articles::Index < Views::Base
  def initialize(articles:)
    @articles = articles
  end

  def page_title = "Articles"
  def layout = Layout

  def view_template
    h1 { "Articles" }

    ul do
      @articles.each do |article|
        li { article.title }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby{2,5,11-13} [base view]
class Views::Base < Phlex::HTML
	include Components

  PageInfo = Data.define(:title)

  def around_template
    render layout.new(page_info) do
      super
    end
  end

  def page_info
    PageInfo.new(
      title: page_title
    )
  end
end
```

```ruby{3,11} [layout]
class Components::Layout < Components::Base
  def initialize(page_info)
    @page_info = page_info
  end

  def view_template
    doctype

    html do
      head do
        title { @page_info.title }
      end

      body { yield }
    end
  end
end
```

## Working with legacy layouts

Using Phlex for the whole view stack makes it faster and also means you can stream responses and use advanced features like selective rendering. But if you’re bringing Phlex into an existing Rails app, there’s no urgent need to convert your layouts over. In fact, the layouts are probably the lowest priority.

You’ll get way more benefits from extracting small, reusable components since you can immediately start rendering them in both your new Phlex views and your old Rails views. Plus, your new Phlex views will render just fine inside normal Rails layouts.

With that said, there _is_ a way to write your layouts in Phlex while still rendering normal non-Phlex views from Rails, though you won’t be able to use streaming.

If you include `Phlex::Rails::Layout`, components can be used as normal Rails layouts. You can even yield symbols to get `content_for` blocks.

```ruby{2,9}
class Components::Layout < Components::Base
  include Phlex::Rails::Layout

  def view_template
    doctype

    html do
      head do
        title { yield(:title) }
      end

      body { yield }
    end
  end
end
```

In the controller, you need to specify the layout with a block.

```ruby
class ArticlesController
  layout { Components::Layout }
end
```
